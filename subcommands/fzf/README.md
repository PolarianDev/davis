# davis-fzf

A command which uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to quickly find
albums in the database. Launch the script with `davis fzf`, and iteratively add
filters. Once done, press escape, and the matching albums will be added to the
queue. By default, `davis-fzf` will only add entire albums, but that can be
easily modified to fit your own preference. The list of tags available in the
menu can also be easily modified in the script.
