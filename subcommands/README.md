# External Subcommands
Davis can be extended with external subcommands. If you have created a useful
one, feel free to open a PR to add it to this collection!

To install one of these commands, copy the relevant script to one of the following places:
- `/etc/davis/bin/`
- `~/.config/davis/bin/`
- A directory in `$PATH`
